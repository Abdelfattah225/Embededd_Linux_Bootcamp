# Project Requirements

## Introduction
This document outlines the requirements and test cases for both server and client components in a network programming context. It covers server initialization, port configuration, connection handling, and client-server interaction.

## Server Requirements

### 1. Server Initialization
- **Requirement**: The server must be able to initialize and start listening on a specified port.
- **Test Case**: 
  - **Objective**: Verify that the server starts correctly and begins listening on the specified port.
  - **Steps**:
    1. Configure the server with a specific port number.
    2. Start the server.
    3. Check if the server is listening on the specified port using tools like `netstat` or `ss`.
  - **Expected Result**: The server should be listed as listening on the configured port.

### 2. Port Configuration
- **Requirement**: The server should allow configuration of the port number on which it will listen for incoming connections.
- **Test Case**:
  - **Objective**: Ensure that the server correctly listens on different specified ports.
  - **Steps**:
    1. Start the server with port A.
    2. Verify that the server is listening on port A.
    3. Stop the server and restart it with port B.
    4. Verify that the server is listening on port B.
  - **Expected Result**: The server should successfully listen on both port A and port B as specified.

### 3. Connection Handling
- **Requirement**: The server should be ready to accept incoming client connections as soon as it starts listening on the specified port.
- **Test Case**:
  - **Objective**: Confirm that the server accepts incoming connections.
  - **Steps**:
    1. Start the server.
    2. Use a client to attempt a connection to the server.
    3. Check server logs or use a monitoring tool to verify the connection was accepted.
  - **Expected Result**: The server should accept the incoming connection from the client.

### 4. Connection State
- **Requirement**: The server must maintain an active listening state until it is explicitly stopped or encounters an error.
- **Test Case**:
  - **Objective**: Verify that the server remains in a listening state until stopped or an error occurs.
  - **Steps**:
    1. Start the server.
    2. Ensure that it continues listening for connections.
    3. Stop the server and check if it properly ceases listening.
  - **Expected Result**: The server should maintain its listening state correctly.

## Client Requirements

### 1. Client Initialization
- **Requirement**: The client must be able to start and initiate a connection request to a server.
- **Test Case**:
  - **Objective**: Ensure the client starts correctly and attempts to connect to the server.
  - **Steps**:
    1. Start the client with a valid server IP and port number.
    2. Check if the client sends a connection request to the server.
  - **Expected Result**: The client should successfully initiate a connection request to the server.

### 2. Server Identification
- **Requirement**: The client must be able to connect to a server identified by a specific IP address and port number.
- **Test Case**:
  - **Objective**: Verify that the client can connect to different servers based on IP and port number.
  - **Steps**:
    1. Start the client with server A's IP and port number.
    2. Verify connection to server A.
    3. Reconfigure the client to connect to server B with a different IP and port.
    4. Verify connection to server B.
  - **Expected Result**: The client should successfully connect to both servers as configured.

### 3. Connection Request
- **Requirement**: The client should be able to establish a connection with the server if the server is listening on the specified IP and port.
- **Test Case**:
  - **Objective**: Ensure that the client establishes a connection if the server is listening.
  - **Steps**:
    1. Start the client with the server's IP and port.
    2. Verify the successful establishment of the connection.
  - **Expected Result**: The client should establish a connection with the server.

### 4. Connection State
- **Requirement**: The client must maintain the connection with the server as long as it is active and should handle connection closure gracefully.
- **Test Case**:
  - **Objective**: Ensure the client maintains the connection and handles closure gracefully.
  - **Steps**:
    1. Start the client and establish a connection.
    2. Ensure the client maintains the connection while active.
    3. Close the connection and verify the client's handling of closure.
  - **Expected Result**: The client should handle connection closure gracefully.

### 5. Connection Failure Handling
- **Requirement**: The client should handle cases where the server is unavailable or refuses the connection.
- **Test Case**:
  - **Objective**: Ensure the client correctly handles cases where the server is unavailable or refuses the connection.
  - **Steps**:
    1. Start the client with a server IP and port where no server is running.
    2. Observe the client's response to the failed connection attempt.
  - **Expected Result**: The client should gracefully handle the failed connection attempt, possibly by retrying or showing an error message.

## Conclusion
This document provides an overview of the requirements and test cases for server and client components in network programming. Proper implementation and testing are crucial for ensuring robust network communication.
